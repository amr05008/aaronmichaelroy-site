      <p>
        I'm the Head of Product at <a href="https://teachable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teachable</a>, an eCommerce platform that's powered $2B+ in sales for online course creators. I also co-founded <a href="https://wami.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wami</a>, where we've built a fleet of robots that write personalized, pen-written notes at scale for luxury brands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I led product at a startup (Bond) through its acquisition by Newell Brands (publicly traded), joined the founding team of 3DPrinterOS (the first 3D printing operating system), and started pedicab companies in New Orleans and Miami.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a BA in Journalism and Political Science and a JD from the University of Connecticut School of Law.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not building products, you'll find me riding bikes, diving into cybersecurity rabbit holes, or with my family. I use this site to share my work, thoughts, and whatever else I'm interested in.
