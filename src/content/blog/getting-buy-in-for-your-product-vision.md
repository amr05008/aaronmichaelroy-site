This is an example of a presentation I used to get cross-functional team members and executive leadership bought into a product vision and launch plan while at Bond. I'm a big fan of framing up the customer's [job's to be done](https://www.intercom.com/resources/books/intercom-jobs-to-be-done) along the user journey We faced an existential crisis at Bond to figure out how to become profitable once Newell Brands acquired us. We knew we had to pivot from 1x1 handwritten notes into something more scalable and with better margins. Hence, this example presentation pitches an evolution of how our target customers (marketing teams) at the time could grow from using the existing 1x1 product into using a new web application to self-service send notes at scale. The presentation outlines the jobs to be done at each stage of the user journey, supporting data, high-level revenue projections, G2M plans, and a scrappy timeline (co-signed with engineering) to get a useable product into the world. **[Product Launch Plan Presentation](//www.slideshare.net/AaronRoy5/product-launch-plan-233306387 "Product Launch Plan Presentation")** from **[Aaron Roy](https://www.slideshare.net/AaronRoy5)**
