I had the chance to give a talk on "[How to manage students, 3D printers and data at scale](https://construct3d2018.sched.com/event/FVg3/how-to-manage-students-3d-printers-and-data-at-scale)," at the Construct3D conference at Georgia Tech University.

Focusing on examples from my [3DPrinterOS](https://3dprinteros.com) work with other top universities, I discussed how educators and engineers could collect and report program data, integrate machines seamlessly into existing IT infrastructure, and maximize access to limited printer resources.

My presentation slides are available below if you would like to learn more.
