_**"What would you make if you had a machine that could make almost anything?"**_

This question was how I started many of the "3D Printing 101" classes I held during my time at [3DPrinterOS](https://www.3dprinteros.com/).

These intro level classes were an introduction to the basics of 3D printing, an overview of the different types of processes involved, and the hardware and software that made this technology possible.

These classes were an essential part of my goal to evangelize 3D printing, and have 3DPrinterOS be the first touchpoint for users just entering the field.

I would often hold these classes [in person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP4iJA4nWu0&t=27s) at the [Brooklyn Public Library](https://3dprint.com/43461/ultimaker-3dprinteros/) or collaboratively [with other 3D Printing companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny0BW80ozxg), but occasionally, I would take this curriculum online.

The video below is a recording from one of the online classes.
