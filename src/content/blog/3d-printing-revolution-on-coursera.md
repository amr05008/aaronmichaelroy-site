It was an honor to be part of the "[3D Printing Revolution](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-printing-revolution)" Coursera created by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This course was listed in the top 50 MOOC's of all time by [Class-Central](https://www.class-central.com/report/top-moocs/).

I taught the section on the "[3D Printing Ecosystem.](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/3d-printing-revolution/3d-printing-ecosystem-aaron-roy-2zjzy)"  This section covers the current state of additive manufacturing, its growth potential, and obstacles to overcome in the years ahead. 

This course demonstrates how 3D printers work, shows the various use cases, and examines the 3D printing ecosystem overall. It also explored the future of 3D printing and discuss how this technology will revolutionize our world. 

The goal for this course was for learners to have a solid understanding of 3D printing and its revolutionary potential and be able to print and customize 3D designs upon completion. 

Considering that this course is free, I highly encourage you to [check it out](https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-printing-revolution)!
