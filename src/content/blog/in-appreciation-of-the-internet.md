What a time to be alive!

We're in the early stages of a global pandemic with covid-19.

The stock markets are searching for a bottom amidst skyrocketing infection and death rates.

And at least here in NYC, we're doing our best to practice social distancing, which means staying away from physical human contact.

It's in these moments I am so grateful for the internet and the infinite world of wonder it provides.

There will be a new normal after this pandemic subsides and we have a better feel for merely how to exist in a world with covid-19 as an additional threat.

The stock market will recover once again one day.

The rebuilding process has started already and will continue gaining strength from the footholds of the digital world.

Stay safe friends!
